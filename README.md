### Experience
**Performance Analyst @ Nan Ya Plastics Corp. USA (February 2025 - Present)**
- Processed and transformed 1,000+ monthly production records and 500+ sales data entries using SQL, designing reusable queries that improved data accessibility by 30% and enabled timely business reporting across departments.
- Automated monthly summary reports and post monthly-closing analysis with advanced Excel (Macros, Power Query), reducing report preparation time by 8 hours per week and enabling cross-functional teams to access timely insights, enhancing KPI tracking across production, sales, backlog, shipping and profitability.
- Developed forecasting models for profit margins, pricing, and production planning through comprehensive data analysis, improving forecast accuracy by 12% and supporting monthly budget planning.
- Created interactive Tableau dashboards for real-time visualization of daily production and operational metrics, empowering plant management to monitor key indicators and make data-driven decisions effectively.

**Data Analyst @ Children's Hosptital of Orange County (Capstone) (September 2024 - December 2024)**
- Extracted, cleaned, and validated 17,000+ patient encounters across multiple datasets (medications, vital signs, labs) using pandas, resolving data inconsistencies and negative time calculations to ensure 99%+ data accuracy.
- Conducted comprehensive EDA on time-series data spanning 72-hrs patient windows, analyzing vital sign trends and lab results to identify treatment patterns, discovering encounter duration as top predictor (0.214 importance).
- Developed 58 analytical features from raw clinical data including statistical summaries and trend calculations, transforming complex data to reveal blood culture patterns and vital sign variability as key patient differentiators.
- Created data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze treatment patterns across patient populations, identifying 95% timely antibiotic therapy rates while quantifying risk factors for delayed treatment protocols.

**Graduate Data Analysis Assistant @ Spatial-Temporal Data Science Lab (UC Irvine) (June 2024 - September 2024)**
- Developed a spatial analysis framework by segmenting Orange County into 500m grids and engineered 15+ features from census datasets using Python (GeoPandas) and ArcGIS Pro for spatial data processing and transformation.
- Merged bicycle crash records (4K+ incidents) in 2022 with 270K+ Strava trips to calculate exposure-adjusted crash rates, identifying high-risk corridors with up to 3.2 times higher incidents in low-income areas.
- Applied statistical analysis showing limited bike lane coverage and higher population density increased crash risk by 2.8 and 1.9 times respectively, providing actionable insights for urban planning.

**Accounting Analyst @ UQI Shipping Logistics (July 2022 - August 2023)**
- Analyzed and validated complex financial data, preparing accurate reports and delivering actionable insights that supported strategic decisions across departments; effectively communicated findings to business stakeholders.
- Developed interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize cost structures and profitability across 2,000+ freight transactions, identifying accounting irregularities and enabling timely operational improvements.
- Built and refined customer risk scoring and credit analysis models using statistical methods and historical data, reducing bad debt risk by 15% and improving cash flow forecasting while maintaining strict data quality standards.
